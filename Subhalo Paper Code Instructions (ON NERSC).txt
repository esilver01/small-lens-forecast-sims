0. Introduction


These are the basic instructions and requirements to run the code at https://github.com/esilver01/small-lens-forecast-sims, used in our paper. It should be possible to replicate all of the results of the paper, though this has not been 100% tested.


One note on the code: the different notebooks may work with various different kernels. Version issues will probably occur, and are probably unavoidable if people are running this code on many different machines. The kernels that we used on NERSC are the following:
NERSC Python: lens_forecast.ipynb, simulations.ipynb, simulations_trunc_SIS.ipynb, figures.ipynb


1. Downloads and Installs


All of the downloads should be available at the default directories in the files. The one thing that needs to be done to set up is to set the Cosmo DC2 root directory:


Cosmo DC2: 
Install GCR Catalogs and set root directory: https://data.lsstdesc.org/doc/install_gcr


2. Lens Forecast (Requires Cosmo DC2 but not VELA)


Run through lens_forecast.ipynb (NERSC Python kernel)
Options set in first code cell after imports:


Method = Zahid or Collett
Counting = lens_in_source, source_in_lens, or both
Sample size factor = 10 (factor times 100,000 samples are used)
Home directory with data = "/global/cfs/projectdirs/deepsrch/jwst_sims/data/" (default)




3. Simulations (Requires Cosmo DC2 and VELA)


Run through simulations.ipynb (NERSC Python kernel) to generate 20,000 lensed images with no noise (noise is added during training)


Options set in first code cell after imports:
Size = ".5-1.5", ".15-.5", or ".02-.15"
Home directory with data = "/global/cfs/projectdirs/deepsrch/jwst_sims/data/" (default)
Path to VELA images = '/global/cfs/projectdirs/deepsrch/vela' (default)


Remember to set the download path in the last code cell when actually simulating a full set of 20,000 images.


4. Figures (Requires generated simulations)


Run through the different sections in figures.ipynb (NERSC Python kernel) to generate the rest of the figures used in the paper that aren’t already in the previous notebooks.
